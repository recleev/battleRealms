<p>Buying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1025600/Battle_Realms_Zen_Edition/">Battle Realms Zen Edition from Steam</a> is one of the best game buys I have ever made. I still remember the few times I spent with the game in computer shops when I was in high school. I only played a few games, and I struggled to play, much more win, against the AI. I wish I could have played Battle Realms more back then.</p>
<p>With the release of the game is steam, I never thought I would be able to have another chance to at least beat the AIs in the game. I am not that big of a fan of real time strategy games because I am not very good at micro-management, but Battle Realms has a certain appeal that makes want to be better at it.</p>
<p>Since I am a returning noob to the game, I still am not very familiar to the different strengths and weaknesses of each unit. I know experience will let acquaint me with all the units, but that will take months, if not years, of playing and practice. Lucky for me, I know <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and the Battle Realms data is accessible with the <a href="https://forums.gamingterritory.com/topic/28424-battle-realms-data-editor-by-situvn/">Battle Realms Data Editor</a>. I took my knowledge and R and my love for Battle Realms to create this fun package.</p>
<p>While there is an official Battle Realms <a href="https://battlerealms.github.io/chart/">unit chart</a>, I think the information in it is incomplete especially for a noob and data lover like. Here is my attempt to provide enthusiasts with a way to review unit strengths and weaknesses. For non-useRs, you can go straight to the <a href="#data-showcase">table</a>.</p>
