# Introduction

Buying [Battle Realms Zen Edition from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1025600/Battle_Realms_Zen_Edition/) is one of the best buys for a game I have ever made. I still remember the few times I spent with the game in computer shops when I was in high school. I only played a few games, and I struggled to play, much more win, against the AI. I wished I could have played Battle Realms more. With the release of the game is steam, I never thought I would be able to have another chance to at least beat the AIs in the game. 

I am not that big of a fan of real time strategy games because I am not very good at micro-management.
